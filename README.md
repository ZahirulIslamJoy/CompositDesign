# Composite Design Pattern Example: Building Structure

This Java program demonstrates the use of the Composite Design Pattern to represent a building composed of generic housing structures, including floors, rooms, and facilities.

## Overview

The Composite Design Pattern is used to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. In this example, we create a building hierarchy:

- **Building**: Represents the entire building.
- **Floor**: Represents a floor within the building, which can contain rooms and facilities.
- **Room**: Represents an individual room within a floor.
- **Facility**: Represents a facility within a floor.

The program demonstrates the composition of these housing structures into a building hierarchy and displays the entire structure.
